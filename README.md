## Installing

drf-cookie-react (DCR) is a [CookieCutter](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) template, and as such can be used
as simply as running two commands :
- First one to install cookiecutter :
```bash
$ pip install cookiecutter
```

- Then the second one to create your new project :
```bash
$ cookiecutter gh:exanis/drf-cookie-react 
```

That's it, you're done !

### Cookiecutter parameters

Here is the list of parameters used when creating your project (those parameters will be prompted by cookiecutter):

- **project_name**: Name of your project
- **project_slug**: A different version of the name of the project (will be auto-generated for you)
- **author_name**: Your name
- **email**: Your email
- **description**: A short description (one line) of the project
- **expose_database**: If set to *y*, docker-compose will expose your database on port 5432. It's probably a better idea to leave it to *n* unless you block this port by yourself on most IPs
- **use_github**: If set to *y*, a github project will be generated (your password will be prompt to generate it, together will the ssh keys used by github)
- **github_owner**: Your Github user name
- **github_user_type**: If you want to create the project on your own github account, leave this to "user". If you want to create it on an organisation account, set the organization name here
- **repository_type**: *private* or *public*
- **use_travis**: Leave *y* to add your project to travis, set to *n* to not
- **use_codacy**: Leave *y* to add your project to codacy, set to *n* to not

### Auto-install feature

When you create your project, it will automatically be installed (as in, a few commands will be run to prepare a DB, etc.)
If you want to avoid this, you can set the ``DRF_COOKIE_NO_INSTALL`` environment variable to 1 when using the ``cookiecutter`` command.

You can always install the project later by using ``make install``, or install it locally (without creating a github project)
with ``make install_local`` (see your project's README for more on this topic)
